# pandas analysis: School District Dataset

Given trends in student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, a few observable trends in the data can be made.

The size of the school seems to have an adverse effect on number of passing scores.  The % passing across math, reading, and overall tended to be worse at schools larger in size, with a notable exception in the top five performing schools.  It appears that the larger schools also spent more per student.

Spending more money did not equate to more passing student scores; in fact, the top schools spent less per student than the bottom performing schools.

The top schools were all charter schools, while the bottom schools were all district schools.

While there is a significant difference between average reading scores between top and bottom performing schools, the difference between passing math scores was much larger.  It seems that math scores either need more attention than reading, or are more sensitive to being adversely affected by the variables associated with a school performing.
